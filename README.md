## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. The sections also contain helpful
links to other pages with more information. In addition, if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. Open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
